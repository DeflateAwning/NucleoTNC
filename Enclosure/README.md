This is an enclosure for the NucleoTNC PCB.  It uses a two-part extruded
aluminum enclosure, SZOMK AK-C-C15 (26*71*100mm).  This folder contains
the faceplates for the enclosure.  These are KiCAD components for the
front and read faceplates.  It also includes a spacer designed to raise
the Nucleo32 board from the PCB so that it will fit into the enclosure.
