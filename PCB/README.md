# NucleoTNC PCB

This directory contains the KiCAD files for the Nucleo TNC PCB.  This is a PCB
for the [NucleoTNC breadboard project](http://www.mobilinkd.com/2019/06/24/nucleotnc/).

The design goal was to allow experimenters to take their breadboard project and give
it a more permanent home on a real printed circuit board.
